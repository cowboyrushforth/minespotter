LiveMine v0.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LiveMine is an experimental node.js minesweeper clone.

It is based on node.js, connect, dnode+socket.io, backbone.js, and jquery.

It is in extreme early stages of development, but progress is happening rapidly.

This is my virgin step into the world of node, so is very much an educational project :)

Big props to the wordsquared guys as their product inspired this!  

Hope to launch this on a public domain for the world to play with some day.
