MineSpotter v0.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MineSpotter is an experimental node.js minesweeper clone.

It is based on node.js, connect, dnode+socket.io, backbone.js, and jquery.

It is in extreme early stages of development, but progress is happening rapidly.

This is my virgin step into the world of node, so is very much an educational project :)

Big props to the wordsquared guys as their product inspired this!  

Hope to launch this on a public domain for the world to play with some day.

To setup development environment you will want to npm install the following packages:
-connect (tested v1.0.6)
-dnode (tested v0.5.7)
-hashish (tested v0.0.2)
-mongoose (tested v1.1.4)
-socket.io (tested v0.6.16)
-underscore (tested v1.1.4)
-node.js itself tested with v0.4.2

You will also need mongodb running where your running node.

Only tested so far in safari and a little in chrome.

Todo:
-stress testing on real hardware
-scores/leaderboard
-facebook login
-minimap
-more asthetics?
-handle bonus mines better -
    -ie when i click on a '4' mine, it should clear
    -more area, then scroll the screen a little
